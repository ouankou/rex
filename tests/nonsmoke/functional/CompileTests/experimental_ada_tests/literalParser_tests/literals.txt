# each line specifies a test
# a test has three comma-separated components: 
#   int/real/string (strings cannot test for , or leading space), 
#   expected numeric value (can be prefixed with space), 
#   string value as specified in source
# note: negative values are not part of Ada literals (the sign serves as unary operator).
