This directory contains code related to generation of JSON-formatted
outputs.

nlohmann:

This is the common nlohmann json library that is widely used in the
C++ community.  The license allows it to be freely distributed with
the constraint that the include file be in $(prefix)/nlohmann/json.hpp
-- the "nlohmann" part shall be preserved.

sarif:

This is an implementation of the Static Analysis Results Interchange
Format (SARIF) v2.1.0 as defined here:

  https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/sarif-v2.1.0.html

The sarif.hpp header was automatically generated using QuickType:

  https://quicktype.io/

Based on the JSON schema:

  https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/cos02/schemas/sarif-schema-2.1.0.json

This automatically generated code has no license restrictions and
only depends on the NLohmann JSON library.  The sarif.hpp header
serves as a bridge between a C++-facing object model and the backing
JSON representation.  An additional layer will be provided within
ROSE that maps ROSE objects to the corresponding SARIF objects as well
as sanitization of the emitted JSON to remove unnecessary null objects
from appearing in the generated JSON.

Note that the VERSION and SCHEMA constants were manually added after the code
was generated by quicktype.
