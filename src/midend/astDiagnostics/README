This directory has code which implements diagnostic capabilities to ROSE translators.

DQ (8/29/2007): 
cycle.h was included (from FFTW) upon the suggestion of Matt Sottile to provide a more
portable version of timers.

MS (11/27/2020):
The AstPerformance.C code now includes tracing facilities to emit traces for use with
Chrome's chrome://tracing viewer or other tools.  By default tracing is disabled.
If you want tracing to be enabled, set the ROSE_TRACEFILE environment variable to
indicate the filename where the trace is to be placed.  Traces will contain
events that are timer durations - each traced event will have a start time and a
duration.  These work well with the Chrome trace viewer.  If you want to use the
profile rollup tool that MS wrote to look at call path profiles, you should
instead toggle tracing of event boundaries by setting the ROSE_TRACEBOUNDARIES
environment variable to any value.  When this is enabled, an event will be emitted
at the start of a timer and a second event will be emitted when the timer ends.
This profile rollup tool is available in the rose-perftools project on the
internal ROSE gitlab instance.
